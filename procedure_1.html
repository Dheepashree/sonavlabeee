			<h2> LOAD CHARACTERISTICS OF DC SHUNT MOTOR </h2>
		<h3> PROCEDURE </h3>
		<p>1.	Connections are given as per the circuit diagram.</p>
		<p>2.	Verify whether the field rheostat of the motor is kept at minimum position.</p>
		<p>3.	By closing the DPST Switch, 230V DC Supply is given.</p>
		<p>4.	Start the motor by using 3 point starter.</p>
		<p>5.	The field rheostat of the motor (i.e., excitation) is adjusted so as to make the motor to run at rated speed. After adjusting the rheostat to the rated speed it should not be altered.</p>
		<p>6.	At no load condition, the input voltage, current, speed are noted. </p>
		<p>7.	Load is applied to the motor upto 125% of rated current by using Brake Drum and the corresponding readings are tabulated.</p>
		<p>8.	Load is gradually decreased and field rheostat is brought to its original position and supply is switched off.</p>
		<p>9.	From the tabulated values the performance characteristic curves are drawn.</p>
