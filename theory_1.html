		<h2> LOAD CHARACTERISTICS OF DC SHUNT MOTOR </h2>
		<h3> THEORY </h3>
		<p> The shunt motor has a definite no load speed the drop in speed 
		from no load to full load is small is 5 to 10% of no load speed. 
		So the motor is usually referred to as constant speed motor. 
		The speed for any load within the operating range of the motor 
		can be readily obtained by varying the field current by means of 
		field rheostat.The shunt motor has a lower starting torque. 
		If twice full load torque is required at starting then the shunt 
		motor draws the full load current.To start a shunt motor it 
		should have enough starting torque and the armature current 
		should be within its safe limit. A three point starter is used 
		for the shunt motor. Usually the efficiency curve is same shape 
		for all motors or generator. </p>
		<h3> PRECAUTIONS </h3>
		<p>1. DC shunt motor should be started and stopped under no load condition.</p>
		<p>2. Field rheostat should be kept in the minimum position.</p>
		<p>3. Brake drum should be cooled with water when it is under load.</p>
