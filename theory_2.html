		<h2> LOAD CHARACTERISTICS OF DC SERIES MOTOR </h2>
		<h3> THEORY </h3>
		<p> It is early observed that at no load the motor current and hence the flux per pole tends to zero and as a consequence the motor speed tends to increase to infinite. This is a dangerous situation and the centrifugal force will destroy the armature flux a series motor must never to allowed to run at no load torque increases the motor speed drops heavily there by the KW load on the motor of this type of speed torque characteristics and is ideally switched for function, cranes, etc., Application were as during starting a large accelerating torque is demanded by the load is at ways on the motor to there is no danger of under loading or no-loading. </p>
		<h3> PRECAUTIONS </h3>
		<p>1. DC series motor should be started and stopped with some load.</p>
		<p>2. Brake drum should be cooled with water when it is under load.</p>
