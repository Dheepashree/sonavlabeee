		<h2> SPEED CONTROL OF DC SHUNT MOTOR </h2>
		<h3> THEORY </h3>
		<p> FIELD CONTROL METHOD </p>
		<p>This method is used when the speed above the no load (rated) speed are required. The speed of motor N α 1/Φ, by decreasing the flux the speed can be increased vice versa the flux could be changed by changing Ish with the help of a field rheostat has to carry only a small current which means I2R losses is small so that rheostat is small in size. This method is therefore efficient in non Interpol or machine the speed could increase in the ratio 2:1. Any further weakening of flux effect the commutation and hence put a limit to the maximum speed obtained with this method. </p>

		<p>ARMATURE CONTROL METHOD</p>
<p>This method is used when the speed below the no load (rated) speed are required. As the supply voltage is normally a constant the voltage across armature is varied by a variable resistance is series with the armature circuit. As this resistance increases, potential difference across the armature decreased by decreasing the armature speed.</p>
 </p>
		<h3> PRECAUTIONS </h3>
		<p> Field Rheostat should be kept in the minimum resistance position and Armature Rheostat should be kept in the maximum resistance position at the time of starting and stopping the motor. </p>
